### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
I am Ted Lu, a 16-year-old student with high interest in data science, medical science and neuroscience located in New Taipei, Taiwan. I am looking for opportunities to explore more on medical informatics and computer vision. 

With the high ability of self learning, I've practiced several skills and abilities among the field of medical informatics., and participated in several research projects. My recent studies focus on methodology development of medical image analysis and imaging studies of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, while Iâ€™ve worked with different imaging modalities including MRI, CT, EEG, X-ray, OCT, etc., and diseases such as glioma, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimerâ€™s, Huntingtonâ€™s and more. 

I have quite a few experiences in hardware development, including sensor engineering and wireless communication. My studies during 2018-2020 were focused on ESP8266/ESP32 communication framework enhancement, edge computing system optimization, etc. The experience enables me with the ability to use various programming languages and systems such as Python, C/C++, JavaScript, Linux and DBMS. 

During my spare time, I also participate in several open source communities such as g0v.tw, CourseAPI, Sch001, etc., where I bring the ability of issue analysis and project management into various open source projects.
