### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
I am Ted Lu, a 17-year-old student and researcher based in Taipei, Taiwan, with a strong focus on data science, medical informatics, and neuroscience. My academic and professional interests revolve around advancing methodologies in medical image analysis and exploring the intersection of digital governance, policy advocacy, and technology. I actively seek opportunities to contribute to fields such as medical informatics and computer vision.

Through self-directed learning and hands-on research, I have cultivated expertise in medical informatics and participated in projects involving diverse imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, EEG, X-ray, and OCT. My recent work has centered on imaging studies of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as glioma, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimerâ€™s, and Huntingtonâ€™s disease. These experiences have honed my skills in Python, data processing frameworks, and imaging analytics.

Beyond the medical domain, I bring technical proficiency in hardware development, including sensor engineering and wireless communication. From 2018 to 2020, I focused on enhancing ESP8266/ESP32 communication frameworks and optimizing edge computing systems. This background has equipped me with robust programming skills in Python, C/C++, JavaScript, Linux, and database management systems.

In addition to technical pursuits, I am deeply engaged in digital governance and policy advocacy, focusing on issues such as open data, digital rights, and internet governance. I have worked with organizations like the Open Culture Foundation and contributed to national policy discussions as a Committee Member of the Youth Advisory Committee for the K-12 Education Administration, addressing topics like educational privacy and inclusion. I also actively participate in open-source communities such as g0v.tw, where I apply my skills in issue analysis and project management to collaborative initiatives.
